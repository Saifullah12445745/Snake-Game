A classic Snake game implemented in Python using the `turtle` graphics module. Control the snake to eat food, grow in length, and avoid crashing into walls or yourself.

This project is designed as a fun introduction to object-oriented programming and simple game loops in Python.

## 🗂️ Project Structure

```
.
├── main.py          # Game loop and screen setup
├── snake.py         # Snake class with movement and growth logic
├── food.py          # Food class with random spawning
├── scoreboard.py    # Score display and game over screen
```

## ⚙️ Requirements

* Python 3.x
* Standard `turtle` module (included with Python)

---

## 🚀 Installation and Running

1️⃣ Clone the repository:

```bash

## 🎮 Controls

* **Arrow Up** – Move Up
* **Arrow Down** – Move Down
* **Arrow Left** – Move Left
* **Arrow Right** – Move Right

## 💻 How It Works

* The snake starts with 3 segments and moves forward continuously.
* Food appears at random positions on the screen.
* Eating food:

  * Increases the score by 1.
  * Extends the snake's length.
* The game ends if:

  * The snake hits the wall.
  * The snake collides with its own tail.
